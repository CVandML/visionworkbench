dnl Usage: AX_PROG_AR
dnl Provides a workaround for Mac OS X's unusual ar behavior, so that
dnl it's possible to build static convenience libraries using libtool
dnl on that platform.  Basically, if we're on a Mac we introduce a
dnl wrapper shell script for ar that detects when we're creating an
dnl empty library and creates it by hand.  In all other cases it just
dnl relays the arguments to the user's AR.
